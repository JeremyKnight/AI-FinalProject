# AI-FinalProject
Artificial intelligent chess player to be played in a tournament. Each player has a timer of three minutes with a 2 second bones each turn played. If you run out of time you lose. If the AI selects an incorrect value, it loses too. We plan to make a genetic algorithm within python to be ran on an executable file. This genetic algorithm will be predicting each move for each of their pieces and the opponentâ€™s pieces for the next turn and will work to find the most optimal path using expectimax and random chance. Through only working through at a depth of one, the program will be able make quicker moves in the beginning which we can (if time permits) be able to dynamically allocate more time to our program to go down more paths to find the optimal game move.
